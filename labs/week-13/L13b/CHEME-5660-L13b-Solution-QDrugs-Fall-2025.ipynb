    "## Problem\n",
    "The Drug Cocktail Design Problem involves selecting a combination of drugs to create a cocktail that maximizes therapeutic effectiveness while staying within budget and safety constraints. Each drug has attributes such as dosage, mechanism of action, and side effects, which contribute to the overall effectiveness of the cocktail.\n",
    "\n",
    "We score each cocktail based on a Cobb-Douglas utility function that considers the attributes of the drugs included in the cocktail:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "U(n_1, \\dots, n_K) = \\kappa(\\gamma) \\prod_{i=1}^{K} n_i^{\\gamma_i}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $n_{i}$ is the concentration of drug $i$, $\\gamma_i$ is an __effectiveness__ parameter for drug type $i$ (output of an effectiveness model), $\\kappa(\\gamma)$ scales the function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\kappa(\\gamma) & = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "-1 & \\text{if any } \\gamma_i < 0 \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effectiveness Coefficients\n",
    "The $\\gamma_{i}$ effectiveness coefficients can reflect the particular characteristics of each drug, such as dosage, mechanism of action, and side effects. The $\\gamma_{i}$ coefficients can be learned from historical data or set based on expert knowledge. We can incorporate various features, such as drug type, dosage, and administration method, into a feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}$:\n",

    "and $\\mathbf{\\theta}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p}$ ($p=m+1$) denotes the feature weights (and bias), learned from data or set based on subjective beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "The drug cocktail design problem is subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "1. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of the drugs in the cocktail must not exceed a specified budget $B$:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\sum_{i=1}^{K} c_i n_i \\leq B\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   where $c_i$ is the cost per unit concentration of drug $i$.\n",
    "2. **Safety Constraint**: The total concentration of drugs in the cocktail must not exceed a safety limit $S$:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\sum_{i=1}^{K} n_i \\leq S\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "3. **Dosage Constraints**: Each drug must be administered within its recommended dosage range:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   n_i^{\\text{min}} \\leq n_i \\leq n_i^{\\text{max}} \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "The Drug Cocktail Design Problem involves selecting a combination of drugs to create a cocktail that maximizes therapeutic effectiveness while staying within budget and safety constraints. Each drug has attributes such as dosage, mechanism of action, and side effects, which contribute to the overall effectiveness of the cocktail. The drug cocktail design problem can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{maximize} \\quad & U(n_1, \\dots, n_K) = \\kappa(\\gamma) \\prod_{i=1}^{K} n_i^{\\gamma_i} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{subject to} \\quad & \\sum_{i=1}^{K} c_i (n_i\\;W) \\leq B\\quad\\text{(budget constraint)}\\\\\n",
    "& \\sum_{i=1}^{K} n_i \\leq S\\quad\\text{(safety constraint)}\\\\\n",
    "& n_i^{\\text{min}} \\leq n_i \\leq n_i^{\\text{max}} \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the objective function is a Cobb-Douglas utility function representing the effectiveness of the drug cocktail, and the constraints ensure that the cocktail stays within budget and safety limits. The design variables are the concentrations of each drug in the cocktail, denoted by $n_i$ for drug $i$ (units: mg/kg), $K$ is the total number of available drugs, and $W$ is the weight of the patient (units: kg). The coefficients $\\gamma_i$ represent the effectiveness of each drug type, which can be learned from historical data or set based on expert knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of constraints ensures that the total cost of the drug cocktail does not exceed a specified budget $B$, where $c_i$ is the cost per unit concentration (e.g., USD/mg) of drug $i$. The second set of constraints ensures that the total concentration of all drugs in the cocktail does not exceed a safety limit $S$. Finally, each drug concentration is bounded by its minimum and maximum allowable levels, denoted by $n_i^{\\text{min}}$ and $n_i^{\\text{max}}$, respectively.\n",

    "# L9d: Estimating a Logistic Regression Binary Classifier using Gradient Descent\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement a logistic regression binary classifier using gradient descent. Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes based on one or more predictor variables. It is widely used in various fields, including machine learning, medical research, and social sciences.\n",

    "> __Learning Objectives:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> After completing this activity, students will be able to: \n",
    "> * **Derive logistic regression from statistical mechanics:** We develop the logistic regression model by viewing binary class labels as states in a Boltzmann distribution and derive the cross-entropy loss function. This approach connects statistical mechanics concepts with machine learning classification problems.\n",
    "> * **Implement gradient descent optimization:** We use gradient descent to minimize the cross-entropy loss function and find optimal classifier parameters. The implementation uses finite difference approximations to compute gradients and iteratively updates parameters until convergence.\n",
    "> * **Train and evaluate a binary classifier:** We train a logistic regression model on the banknote authentication dataset and evaluate its performance using a confusion matrix. The model learns to distinguish genuine from forged banknotes based on wavelet-transformed image features.\n",

    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Cross-entropy loss minimization:** We minimized the negative log-likelihood function (cross-entropy loss) to find optimal classifier parameters. The gradient descent algorithm iteratively updated parameters using a learning rate of 0.005 until convergence.\n",
    "> * **Training and testing data split:** We randomly partitioned the banknote dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data. This split allowed us to evaluate how well the trained model generalizes to unseen examples.\n",
    "> * **Performance evaluation with confusion matrix:** We computed a confusion matrix to assess the classifier's performance on the test set. The matrix shows true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for genuine versus forged banknote classifications.\n",
